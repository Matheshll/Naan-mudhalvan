Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

Project Definition:

The project at hand revolves around the comprehensive analysis of data from public health awareness campaigns. The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of these campaigns in reaching their target audience and increasing awareness of critical health issues. This analysis aims to provide valuable insights that not only evaluate the impact of past campaigns but also serve as a foundation for shaping future strategies in the field of public health communication.

Design Thinking:

Analysis Objectives:

To effectively analyze public health awareness campaign data, it is crucial to establish specific objectives that will guide our efforts. These objectives include:

1\. Measuring Audience Reach: Determine the extent to which the campaigns reached the intended audience. This involves understanding the reach across different demographics and regions.

2\. Assessing Awareness Levels: Evaluate the increase in awareness levels related to the specific health issues targeted by the campaigns. This could involve measuring changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.

3\. Campaign Impact Evaluation: Quantify the overall impact of the campaigns on public health outcomes, such as disease prevention, early detection, or improved health-seeking behavior.

Data Collection:

Collecting accurate and relevant data is pivotal for meaningful analysis. Here's a plan for data collection:

1\.Identify Data Sources:Determine the sources of campaign data, which may include social media analytics, website traffic, traditional media coverage, and awareness surveys.

2\. Engagement Metrics: Collect data on campaign engagement metrics such as likes, shares, comments, and click-through rates for digital campaigns. For offline campaigns, consider media coverage and event attendance.

3\. Audience Demographics: Gather data on the demographics of the audience reached by the campaigns, including age, gender, location, and socioeconomic factors.

4\. Awareness Surveys: Conduct surveys to measure changes in awareness levels among the target audience before and after the campaigns.

Visualization Strategy:

Effective data visualization is key to conveying insights. Develop a strategy for creating informative visualizations using IBM Cognos:

1\. Dashboard Design: Design interactive dashboards that provide a holistic view of campaign performance. Include key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and demographic breakdowns.

2\. Visual Representation: Utilize various visual elements, such as charts, graphs, heatmaps, and geospatial maps, to present data in an understandable and visually appealing manner.

3\. Storytelling:Create narratives within the dashboards to guide users through the data and highlight important findings. Use storytelling to make the data relatable and actionable.

Code Integration:

Code integration can enhance the analysis process. Determine which aspects of the analysis can benefit from code:

1\. Data Cleaning: Automate the cleaning and preprocessing of raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2\. Transformation: Use code to transform data into suitable formats for analysis, such as aggregating engagement data over time periods or calculating awareness score changes.

3\. Statistical Analysis: Employ statistical analysis techniques, including hypothesis testing and regression analysis, to gain deeper insights into the relationships between campaign variables and outcomes.

In summary, this project involves a thorough examination of public health awareness campaigns, with a focus on defining clear analysis objectives, collecting comprehensive data, designing impactful visualizations, and strategically integrating code where beneficial. This structured approach will enable us to uncover valuable insights and contribute to the improvement of future public health communication strategies.
